## 👨‍💻 About Me  

- 🎓 Engineering Graduate  
- 🔧 DevOps-focused learner with hands-on experience  
- 🐳 Built and debugged multi-container Docker applications  
- 🌐 Deployed real applications on AWS EC2  
- 🧠 Strong belief: *“If you can debug it, you understand it.”*  

I am not focused on certificates or theory-heavy learning.  
I focus on **how systems actually behave in real environments**.

## 🧠 What I’m Currently Learning (Real, Hands-On)

- Linux server fundamentals  
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Flask application deployment  
- Gunicorn vs development servers  
- Nginx as reverse proxy & load balancer  
- AWS EC2 deployment & networking  
- Debugging real container and server issues  

---

## 🏗️ What I’ve Built & Experienced

### 🔹 Multi-Container Flask Application (Real Project)

- Flask application running in **multiple backend containers**
- Nginx configured as a **load balancer (round-robin)**
- Gunicorn used for **production-ready serving**
- Deployed and tested on **AWS EC2**
- Verified load balancing using **hostname & container ID**
- Faced and fixed real issues like:
  - containers exiting immediately
  - `docker ps` showing nothing
  - missing gunicorn binary
  - port binding and networking issues

**Tech Used:**  
Docker · Docker Compose · Flask · Gunicorn · Nginx · AWS EC2 · Linux
