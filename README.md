## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m MD Rahmanuddin, an engineer and practical tech builder with experience in DevOps, Python, AI/ML, CAD design, and IoT systems.

I bring **6.5+ years of professional experience in CAD & CATIA V5**, working on mechanical and automotive component design, surface modeling, and production-ready drawings.

Alongside engineering design, I actively build and deploy software systems, automate workflows with Python, integrate ML models into APIs, and develop IoT-based solutions.

My approach is hands-on, problem-driven, and focused on real-world implementation.
