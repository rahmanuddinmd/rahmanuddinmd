## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m MD Rahmanuddin, an engineer and practical tech builder with experience in DevOps, Python, AI/ML, and CAD design. I learn by doing. I prefer building real systems, debugging them, and understanding how they behave in real environments.

I’ve worked on containerized applications, deployed services on AWS, designed mechanical components in CATIA V5, and integrated machine learning models into production-style APIs. My approach is hands-on rather than theory-heavy, and I enjoy solving problems end to end.

Whether it’s automating workflows with Python, deploying scalable services, or optimizing engineering designs, I focus on real implementation and measurable improvement.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 Multi-Container Flask Deployment

Built a distributed web application using Docker and Docker Compose:

- Multiple backend containers  
- Gunicorn for production serving  
- Nginx as reverse proxy and load balancer  
- Deployed and tested on AWS EC2  
- Debugged container crashes, port conflicts, networking issues, and dependency problems  

**Tech Stack:** Docker · Flask · Gunicorn · Nginx · AWS · Linux · Python  

---

### 🔹 Machine Learning Model API Service

Developed a production-style ML service:

- Trained supervised learning models on structured datasets  
- Implemented data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exposed model inference through Flask APIs  
- Containerized the service using Docker  
- Analyzed model performance and overfitting behavior  

**Tech Stack:** Python · Scikit-learn · Pandas · NumPy · Flask · Docker  

---

### 🔹 CAD Design & Automation

Worked on mechanical and automotive component development using CATIA V5:

- 3D part and assembly modeling  
- Surface modeling and trim design  
- GD&T and tolerance analysis  
- Parametric design techniques  
- Python-based automation for repetitive CAD tasks  

**Tools:** CATIA V5 · CAD · Python Automation

## 🤖 AI & Machine Learning Experience

My focus in AI/ML is practical application rather than just experimentation.

- Data handling and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy  
- Supervised learning model training and evaluation  
- Understanding overfitting, bias-variance tradeoffs, and model generalization  
- Converting ML models into API services  
- Containerizing ML applications for reproducibility  
- Studying how models behave in real deployment environments  

I aim to bridge the gap between ML development and production systems.
